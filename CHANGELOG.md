# Changelog

All notable changes to YapStack will be documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0-alpha.6] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed
- Voice dictation: random/garbled characters when copying transcripts via `pbcopy` on macOS — `LC_CTYPE` is now forced to `UTF-8` when invoking `pbcopy` so multibyte output round-trips correctly (#15).
- CI: install `cmake` before the Rust build so whisper.cpp configures cleanly.
- CI: pass `-march=native` so whisper.cpp detects `i8mm` on Apple Silicon runners.
- CI: stub `libwebgpu_dawn.dylib` placeholder alongside the existing ONNX Runtime placeholders.

### Added
- `AGENTS.md` as canonical AI-agent instruction file (cross-tool standard); `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.cursor/rules/main.mdc` are stubs that point to it.
- `docs/INDEX.md` (doc router), `docs/GLOSSARY.md` (domain terms), `docs/AGENT_GUIDE.md` (navigation + task recipes), `docs/LINEAR_TICKETS.md` (agent-pickup ticket structure).
- `docs/adr/` directory with ADR-0001 (adopt AGENTS.md).
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/agent_ready_task.yml` for AI-agent-pickup tickets.
- CONTRIBUTING.md sections: Quickstart, Where to start, AI-Assisted Contributions, Definition of Done, Verification commands, Scope boundaries.
- AGENTS.md "Permission boundaries" section (Always / Ask first / Never) and a pre-commit checklist.

### Changed
- CONTRIBUTING.md restructured for both human and AI contributors.
