## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0-alpha.11] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- **Dictation works during an active session.** Hitting a dictation hotkey while a recording session is in progress now returns the dictated text (paste / clipboard / new-note, per slot config) without disturbing the session. Dictated content stays out of the session transcript: the session's own mic-side processing suspends for the duration of the dictation, with a rising-edge flush that preserves the partial word the user spoke just before triggering the hotkey, and a falling-edge reset that drops the dictation window's audio from session VAD state (#48).
- New `LiveSourceKind` (`session` | `dictation`) routing dimension carried end-to-end on every live-transcription event (segments, status, backfill-complete) and accepted on `start_live_transcription` / `stop_live_transcription` / `get_live_transcription_status`. Two-prong frontend filters (`source_kind` + `session_id`) keep dictation lifecycle from leaking into session UI state and vice-versa (#48).
- New scheduler `JobOrigin::Dictation` priority tier — order is `FinalFlush > Dictation > Live (mic/system round-robin) > Backfill`. Dictation chunks jump the queue past session live chunks. The scheduler is non-preemptive, so a dictation chunk still waits behind any sidecar job already in flight at trigger time (#48).
- **Frontend logs now land in the unified log file and LogsPanel.** A new Tauri-side bridge routes JS `log.error/warn/info/debug` calls, every `console.error` / `console.warn`, uncaught errors, and unhandled promise rejections through the same `tracing` subscriber that handles native logs — so they appear on stderr, in the rolling daily file under `app_log_dir()`, and in LogsPanel alongside Rust output. A "Snapshot" button in LogsPanel captures a JS-heap snapshot on demand, and a 60 s background sampler records process RSS so heap-growth analysis works on macOS where WKWebView doesn't expose `performance.memory` (#44).

### Changed
- The transcription scheduler is now a **long-lived app-level singleton**. It's constructed once at engine init and shared by every live runtime (one session + one dictation concurrently); previously each session built its own scheduler and round-tripped the `TranscriptionClient` back into shared state on stop. `init_transcription_client` is now idempotent on a matching engine/config and returns an explicit "shut down first" error on mismatch — engine swap is an explicit two-step operation. `submit()` returns `Result<Receiver, SchedulerError>` and rejects with `Shutdown` once the scheduler is terminal so racing `Arc<Scheduler>` clones can't enqueue into a dead worker. Backfill-gating is now a per-producer bitmask (`{LiveMic, LiveSystem, Dictation}`) so one runtime clearing its bit while another is mid-utterance can't unblock backfill prematurely (#48).
- `LiveTranscriptionState` is now a two-slot struct (`session`, `dictation`) with explicit `Idle | Starting | Running | Stopping` lifecycle states — same-kind double-start is rejected even during the finalization window, so a stop-then-fast-start can't race the prior task's tail emission (#48).
- **AI chat tool invalidation fires per round, not at end-of-conversation.** Each tool's `execute()` writes to SQLite immediately as the model emits the call, so the UI store needs to reflect those writes as they happen — both for the human (list view) and for the model's `getToolContext()` snapshot on the next round. `useChatMessages.handleSend` now invokes `onToolsExecuted` for the tools that ran in each round at the natural per-round boundary, dropping the previous batched-at-end call. Side effect: a chat that errors after one round still leaves the store consistent with what landed on disk, so the session list won't desync from the DB after a rate-limit / network drop (#52).
- **Dictation volume ducking is now reduce-by-percentage, not set-to-percentage.** Matching Discord and the Windows ducking model, the slider now lowers the *current* system volume by the configured fraction (`current × (1 − amount)`) rather than snapping to an absolute level — quiet starting volumes get gently nudged, loud starts drop further. Existing users' settings are converted in the persist merge (`new = 1 − old`) so effective duck strength is preserved. Setting label and subtext clarify "while dictating" instead of the older generic "while recording" (#49).

### Fixed
- **Double-clicking a chat action (Summarize, Key Points, etc.) no longer fires the action twice.** The `isStreaming` React state guard didn't apply the disabled attribute until the next render, so a fast second click on the same `CommandItem` slipped through and triggered duplicate LLM requests (and could trip OpenAI rate limits when chained). `useChatMessages.handleSend` now bails synchronously via a `useRef` reentrancy guard (#51).
- **Hour-long timestamps now wrap correctly.** Sessions and chat timestamps past 60 minutes render as `1:00:00` / `1:01:00` instead of `60:00` / `61:00`. A third copy of the same buggy formatter inside `AIChatMessage` is replaced with the shared `formatTime` (#43).
- **Right-click actions on transcript segments (Edit / Delete / Hide / Insert into Notes) now take effect immediately during an active recording.** The DB write happened right away, but `refreshViewSessionSegments` early-returned for the live session — so `activeSessionSegments` (the array `NoteDetailView` renders during recording) didn't update until stop. The action looked like a no-op until the session ended (#45).
- **Resize handle no longer shows a stray blue focus outline** (#50).
- **Drag-select on the transcript starts from anywhere in the visible area.** Previously a drag that began on the top or bottom edge of a segment bubble fell through to native text selection and painted a blue highlight. The marquee now starts on any `pointerdown` in the container and promotes after a 6 px movement threshold; sub-threshold clicks still trigger the bubble's `onClick` (a one-shot `onClickCapture` interceptor blocks the synthesized click on a real drag), and active editing controls are exempt so caret/drag-select inside a contenteditable bubble is never clobbered. Marquee rendering also moved off React state, so a drag now performs zero React work per `pointermove` (#60).
- **Live-transcription audio offsets stay correct across device-change buffer swaps.** When the ring buffer was replaced mid-session (e.g. AirPods reconnect), every post-swap chunk's `audio_offset_seconds` was being rewound by however many seconds of wall clock had elapsed inside the loop — a 60-min wall / 58-min audio session was observed landing with `final_lag_secs ≈ 388 s` and all post-swap segments stamped ~6 min behind real session-time. A per-source `audio_offset_anchor_seconds` now advances on every `BufferReplaced`; in-flight rescue chunks and pre-swap unflushed audio are preserved through the swap (with WAV append for `MicOnly` / `SystemOnly`); an in-flight dictation window is rebased into the new buffer's coordinate space rather than dropped; and both rescues are truncated at the earliest dictation boundary so dictated audio can't leak into session content. New `marker = "buffer_replaced_rebase"` info log carries the diagnostic state for after-the-fact analysis (#59).

## [1.0.0-alpha.10] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed
- **Right-click context-menu actions on transcription segments now fire.** Edit / Copy / Insert into Notes / Hide / Delete had been silently no-op'ing — the transcript's drag-select handler was treating menu-item clicks as marquee starts and swallowing the click (#28).

### Changed
- **Settings → General footer rebranded** (#29).

## [1.0.0-alpha.9] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Auto-failover on device change** — the device picker now reflects the OS state in real time. When AirPods drop, a USB mic is unplugged, or the user changes the system default in Settings, capture automatically rebinds the affected Stream to the new system default and shows a transient toast naming the new device ("Switched mic to MacBook Pro Microphone"). System-audio loopback follows the default output (and the alerts/UI route) the same way. `Mixed` capture stops both Sources fail-fast if either can't be recovered (#25).
- New Tauri event `devices-changed`. The frontend replaces its cached device list and reconciles the persisted `selectedMicDeviceId` when its device disappears. The broker re-emits this event whenever the device list changes *or* any system default flips, so the FE store's `is_default` flags always reflect the current OS state without a second listener (#25).
- Fourth Core Audio property listener for `kAudioHardwarePropertyDefaultSystemOutputDevice` (the alerts/UI route), distinct from the media output selector (#25).
- `RestartTarget::FollowDefault` mode for `restart_mic`/broker-driven failover. Probes the new system default *first*, then falls through to stored id/name. The watchdog path keeps `PreserveBinding` (stored id first) for stream-error / write-pos-stall recovery (#25).
- **Multi-color highlights in the note editor.** Yellow, green, blue, purple, red palette themed for both light and dark; pick from the highlight dropdown in the toolbar or selection bubble. Highlights re-theme automatically — they're stored as CSS variable references that resolve per theme at render time (#26).
- **Heading dropdown shows the current level.** The heading button reads "H1" / "H2" / "Normal" and the active row inside the dropdown is highlighted (#26).
- **Selection bubble menu is scoped to inline marks** — bold, italic, underline, strike, code, highlight, link. Block-level formatting (headings, lists, blockquote, code block) lives in the static toolbar, matching Notion / Linear / Novel conventions (#26).
- **Static toolbar adds Link and Code Block buttons.** Multi-line fenced ` ``` ` code blocks were already supported by the input rule and round-trip through markdown; the toolbar now exposes them alongside an explicit Link control (#26).
- **Pasting markdown with fenced code blocks parses correctly.** When a paste's plain-text payload contains a ` ``` ` fence and there's no rich HTML alternative on the clipboard, the paste is parsed as markdown — so copying a code block out of a terminal, GitHub issue, or markdown file lands as a real code block instead of a flat string (#26).

### Changed
- The Rust audio crate's listener path moved from `AtomicBool` flag-polling to a runtime-agnostic `DeviceEventSink` consumed by an always-on Tauri-side broker. The broker debounces bursty Core Audio events in a 250 ms window and gates restarts on `kAudioDevicePropertyDeviceIsAlive`, replacing the previous unconditional 200 ms `thread::sleep` workaround for the AirPods/Bluetooth revert window (#25).
- Dropped the defensive ~30 s name-comparison drift poll inside the live-transcription loop. Device changes flow exclusively through the broker now; the missed-event safety net is no longer needed (#25).
- `stream-health` event payload now carries `bound_device_name` so the FE can render device names in auto-failover toasts (#25).
- Promoted broker decisions (debounce flush, failover routing source/target, same-device rebind warnings) to `info`/`warn` level so the failover chain is visible in default-level logs without enabling `RUST_LOG=debug` (#25).
- **Toolbar and bubble-menu active states are reactive and visible.** Buttons re-render on selection changes (via `useEditorState`) and gain an accent underline when their mark or block is active, so cases like "bold persists on a new line" are obvious (#26).
- **Sidebar shortcut moved from ⌘B to ⌘\\ (Notion convention)** so it stops fighting TipTap's bold binding inside notes. Both shortcuts now work as intended; existing custom rebinds are preserved (#26).
- **In-app shortcuts can fire while typing in a note.** Command palette (⌘K), sidebar (⌘\\), settings (⌘,), filter switches (⌘1/⌘2), new note (⌘N), stop recording (⌘.), toggle chat (⌘J), and pin (⌘D) now work with editor focus. Escape and ⌘⌫ still defer to the editor (#26).
- **Selection bubble menu stays inside the editor.** Floating UI's flip/shift now use the editor's contenteditable as the boundary, so the bubble can no longer land on the static toolbar above or the floating chat bar below; it also renders at `z-50` so it always sits above other floating UI (#26).

### Fixed
- cpal's runtime-allocated loopback aggregate (`com.cpal.LoopbackRecordAggregateDevice`) no longer appears in the input-device picker. The aggregate is a private cpal implementation detail used for system-audio loopback; it leaked into in-process device enumeration despite being flagged private to System Settings, and selecting it as a microphone crashed capture with "stream type not supported." Filtered at enumeration time and additionally rejected by `start_mic` as defense-in-depth (#25).
- `device_liveness` (formerly `is_device_alive`) now actually gates broker-driven restarts on macOS. The previous `strip_cpal_prefix` helper expected `"CoreAudio:"` (CamelCase), but cpal's `HostId::Display` lowercases — the real prefix is `"coreaudio:"`. Since the helper was a no-op for every real device id, the AirPods-revert IsAlive gate had been bypassing every gate-check since this code shipped (#25).
- Broker-driven Mic failover now actually moves to the new default. The old probe order (stored-id → stored-name → default) caused the live loop to silently re-bind to the *previous* device whenever it was still alive — exactly the symptom users hit when plugging into a Thunderbolt dock that brings a new audio interface online while the laptop's built-in mic stays present (#25).
- Devices with empty names are filtered from the picker so the dropdown can't render a confusing blank entry (#25).
- **Explicit microphone disappearance now fails over to the system default.** The broker's explicit-pick liveness check used a single boolean that fail-opened on "couldn't tell" — an unplugged USB mic that was missing from the device list still reported `alive=true`, so subsequent `DefaultInputChanged` events were silently dropped. Replaced with a tri-state `DeviceLiveness` (`Alive`/`Dead`/`Absent`/`Unknown`); the explicit-pick branch now only skips failover on `Alive` (#25).
- **Broker-driven `FollowDefault` restart now correctly updates `bound_is_default`.** Previously the flag was preserved verbatim across restart, so an explicit pick that disappeared and successfully fell over to the system default still flagged the binding as "explicit" — future default changes were silently ignored. The flag is now derived from "did the post-restart bind id match the resolved default?" (#25).
- **Mid-stop device-change events can no longer race the live-transcription final flush.** The broker's direct-restart fallback used inbox-presence to decide between routing through the live loop and calling `AudioManager::restart_*` directly. `stop_live_transcription` clears the inbox before the loop's final flush completes, so a device-change in that window would replace the ring buffer while the loop was still extracting at snapshotted stop positions. Added a separate `LiveSessionPresent` flag the spawned task clears only after scheduler shutdown, and routing now consults it (#25).
- **`devices-changed` is now re-emitted on any default-device change**, not just on `DeviceListChanged`. Prevents stale `is_default` flags in the FE store when only the system default flips (e.g. user picks a different mic in System Settings) (#25).
- **Note checklist checkboxes are themed and aligned.** Checked state uses the accent color with a contrast checkmark and a focus-visible ring; the checkbox aligns with the first line of text and stays aligned across wraps (#26).

### Removed
- `AudioManager::{mic_default_changed, system_audio_default_changed, device_list_changed, mic_input_drifted, system_audio_output_drifted, live_default_input_name, live_default_output_name}` and `DefaultDeviceWatcher::take_change` — superseded by the event-driven sink path (#25).

## [1.0.0-alpha.8] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Dictation volume ducking (macOS).** Opt-in setting on the Dictation tab lowers the system output volume to a configured target (default 20%) while a dictation is recording, then restores it the moment recording ends. Only ever lowers — never raises — so a quieter starting volume isn't bumped up. Tracks the *device* you started ducking, so swapping outputs mid-dictation (AirPods connect, USB DAC unplug) restores the original device rather than leaving it stuck at the ducked level. No-op on Windows / Linux (#22).

### Changed
- **Backfill no longer starves live transcription.** Long backfill jobs are now sliced and yield to live work at the sidecar. Live audio keeps up with real time even when a fresh session is rewinding into a full 5-minute backfill window (#20).
- **Stopping a live session is now a clean cut-off.** When you press stop, the loop snapshots the audio boundary at that instant plus a short tail grace, finalizes whatever's inside, and ignores anything captured after. The final transcript and WAV no longer drift based on host load (#20).
- **Session WAV uses the right sample rate** for the configured capture source (`MicOnly`, `SystemOnly`, or `Mixed`) rather than always preferring whichever buffer happened to exist (#20).
- **Live-status diagnostics:** the slow-sidecar indicator now reports preserved-drain backlog (audio queued behind inference) instead of the old head-drop counter, which implied audio was being discarded. Audio is now preserved through catch-up; the new fields show how far behind the live tier is (#20).
- **Repository now follows the `AGENTS.md` convention** for AI-assistant instructions. `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and `.cursor/rules/main.mdc` are now thin stubs pointing at the canonical `AGENTS.md`. New documentation routing under `docs/INDEX.md`, `docs/GLOSSARY.md`, `docs/AGENT_GUIDE.md`, `docs/LINEAR_TICKETS.md`, and `docs/adr/`. CONTRIBUTING.md restructured for both human and AI contributors with Quickstart, Definition of Done, and Verification commands sections.
- **Internal sidecar crate renamed** `yapstack-sidecar` → `yapstack-transcription-sidecar` to make room for additional sidecar workers (e.g. embeddings) without naming ambiguity. No user-visible behaviour change; build scripts are now `scripts/build-sidecars.sh` (wrapper) and `scripts/build-transcription-sidecar.sh` (#21).

### Fixed
- **Session MP3 export no longer silently downsamples.** A 48 kHz capture exported at 64 kbps is now written at 48 kHz; previously LAME's auto-rate selection dropped it to 22.05 kHz, leaving the audio file and the database disagreeing on sample rate (#20).
- **"Processing prior audio" divider** in the chat now sits at the actual backfill→live boundary instead of being pinned to the bottom of the transcript. As the rewind buffer streams in, the divider slides up into the right place (#19).
- **Lag metric is no longer overstated** when backfill chunks arrive after live chunks. The reported lag tracks the maximum completed audio offset rather than overwriting on every chunk, so a late backfill chunk for older audio can't pull the counter backwards and inflate the displayed lag (#20).
- **"Backfill in progress" affordance clears immediately** when there's nothing to backfill (resume, empty buffer, or a backfill request that the ring buffer can't honor). Previously the badge could stay stuck for the entire session (#20).
- **Transcription engine self-heals after a wedged shutdown.** If the engine fails to release cleanly when stopping a session (rare; happens when the sidecar hangs past the 5-minute drain ceiling), the app now resets engine state and re-runs auto-setup before the next action instead of leaving the next session to fail with `NotInitialized` (#20).
- **Dev sidecar mirror now survives `cargo` rebuilds.** Local development could leave the feature-rich sidecar binary clobbered by a feature-poor `cargo build` rebuild, breaking subsequent `pnpm tauri dev` runs (#18).

## [1.0.0-alpha.7] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- Folder auto-recommendation: when keywords from a folder's name, description, or tags on sessions previously filed under it appear in the live transcript, the top folder surfaces inline above the session view as a "Recommended" pill. Click the pill to confirm "Add to {folder}", pick a different folder from the full list, or dismiss. Single-folder workspaces show inline accept/dismiss instead of a dropdown (#17).
- Default dictation slots for new users: "Clean & Focus" (Ctrl+Shift+C) and "Engineer" (Ctrl+Shift+X) AI post-processors alongside Raw Dictation (now bound to Ctrl+Shift+D). Existing users' configured slots are untouched (#17).
- Mid-session folder picker: the session header actions dropdown renders during recording with a Folders submenu, so a session can be filed without stopping it (#17).
- "Show audio file" action on dictation history entries (icon button + context-menu item) — reveals the WAV/MP3 in Finder, matching the existing session affordance (#17).
- Mic-only clarification in the Dictation settings header so users know dictation never captures system audio (#17).

### Changed
- Rewind dropdown supports short buffers: the "Full buffer" action now honors any available backfill — including sub-30-second and sub-second amounts — rather than gating on hardcoded steps. Sub-second precision is preserved end-to-end (#16).
- Engine and capture status now surface only via the title-bar status dot. The centered "Loading transcription engine…" banner in the main content area is gone. The dot pulses amber during downloading/initializing and is steady green only when actually capturing (#17).
- Mid-session context menu replaces the disabled "Delete" with a destructive "Stop recording" entry so users have an actionable path forward instead of a silently disabled item (#17).
- Rebinding a shortcut to a key already used by another shortcut (or dictation slot) now rejects with a toast naming the conflicting owner. Previously the new binding silently stole the key from its prior owner (#17).
- Updater install progress bar is strictly monotonic. Repeated `Started` events and out-of-order chunk callbacks no longer pull the bar backward; sub-1% chunks no longer trigger redundant re-renders. The same guard applies to the model-download progress (Whisper / Parakeet / Sortformer fetch) (#17).

### Fixed
- Auto-suggested folder no longer keeps surfacing other folders after the user has already filed the session. Acceptance and override are now one-shot for the session; dismiss stays per-folder so the next-best match can still surface if the user keeps rejecting picks (#17).

## [1.0.0-alpha.6] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed
- Voice dictation: random/garbled characters when copying transcripts via `pbcopy` on macOS — `LC_CTYPE` is now forced to `UTF-8` when invoking `pbcopy` so multibyte output round-trips correctly (#15).
- CI: install `cmake` before the Rust build so whisper.cpp configures cleanly.
- CI: pass `-march=native` so whisper.cpp detects `i8mm` on Apple Silicon runners.
- CI: stub `libwebgpu_dawn.dylib` placeholder alongside the existing ONNX Runtime placeholders.

## [1.0.0-alpha.5] - 2026-04-28
