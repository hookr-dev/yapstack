/**
 * Live insights — user-defined LLM extractions that run against the live
 * session transcript and render their output in the floating Insight overlay.
 *
 * An Insight has two orthogonal axes:
 *   - **Type** — *what* it extracts (its system prompt). Templates (Rolling
 *     Summary, Glossary, Action Items, …) seed a starter prompt + a recommended
 *     cadence; editing the prompt makes the type "custom".
 *   - **Cadence** — *when* it fires (the trigger timing: Responsive / Balanced
 *     / Relaxed / Custom). Independent of content.
 *
 * Only one Insight is active at a time (the Current Insight); inactive insights
 * are dormant and consume no LLM calls.
 *
 * See docs/UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md "Live insights" section for the canonical
 * vocabulary (Insight, Insight type / template, cadence, Insight trigger,
 * Insight tick, Insight fire, Insight result, Insight overlay, Insight backfill).
