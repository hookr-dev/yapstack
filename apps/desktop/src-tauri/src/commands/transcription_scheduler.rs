//! Transcription scheduler: a single-worker priority queue in front of the
//! sidecar lane.
//!
//! The sidecar processes requests serially on the model side; two concurrent
//! `transcribe_with` calls both land in the sidecar's stdin queue in FIFO
//! order, with no way to prefer fresh live speech over historical backfill.
//! The scheduler fixes that: every transcription is submitted as a `Job` with
//! a priority (`FinalFlush > Dictation > Live > Backfill`). A single worker
//! task picks the highest-priority job available, calls `transcribe_with`,
//! and responds via a per-job oneshot. Within the `Live` priority, mic/system
//! sources alternate in strict round-robin so neither can starve the other
//! during a sustained dual-source session. Backfill is also gated by the
//! per-producer busy bitmask so historical work only enters the non-
//! preemptible sidecar lane while every live producer (session mic, session
//! system, dictation) is idle.
//!
//! Lifetime: the scheduler is constructed once at engine init and lives until
//! engine shutdown. Multiple live runtimes (one session, one dictation) clone
//! `Arc<Scheduler>` and submit into the same worker. `submit` rejects with
//! `SchedulerError::Shutdown` once `shutdown_client` has begun, so racing
//! callers that hold a stale clone don't enqueue work into a dead worker.
//!
//! Sidecar liveness: because the worker is the *sole* caller of
//! `transcribe_with`, a transient sidecar error can be resolved cleanly — the
//! worker owns the only live `Arc<TranscriptionClient>` clone outside of its
//! own brief in-call clone, so `Arc::try_unwrap` succeeds at `respawn()` time.
//!
//! Backfill on stop: the session live loop submits any in-flight speech as
//! `FinalFlush` jobs, then awaits the *backfill submitter task* (the one
//! spawned in `live_transcription.rs::process_backfill`). The submitter
//! awaits each chunk's scheduler response before submitting the next — per-
//! chunk prompt context and in-order segment emission both depend on this
//! serial wait — so the submitter, not the scheduler, is what's actually
//! draining backfill post-stop. The session-level shutdown timeout in the
//! live loop is the real ceiling on backfill drain; `shutdown_client`'s
//! timeout only fires at engine shutdown, not at session end.
