# Release runbook

How to cut and ship a YapStack release. Owned end-to-end by a maintainer with access to the `release` GitHub Actions environment and the Tauri minisign signing secret.

## What a release is

A release is a git tag of the form `vX.Y.Z` (or `vX.Y.Z-prerelease`) on `main`. Pushing the tag triggers [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml), which:

1. Builds the macOS Apple Silicon target with code signing + notarization.
2. Generates `latest.json` (Tauri auto-updater manifest) referencing the signed `.app.tar.gz`.
3. Creates a **draft** GitHub Release with the DMG, the updater bundle + minisign signature, `latest.json`, and SHA-256 checksums attached.

The draft is the maintainer's last review gate. Nothing ships to existing installs until the draft is published — `latest.json` only gets served from the release URL once the draft is no longer a draft.

## Versioning

- **Semantic versioning.** `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, with `-alpha.N` / `-beta.N` / `-rc.N` prereleases.
- We are currently on the `1.0.0-alpha.N` series. Bump `N` for each alpha cut. Drop the `-alpha.N` suffix only when promoting to `1.0.0`.
- The Tauri minisign **public key** in [`apps/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`](../apps/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json) is **never** rotated as part of a release. Rotating it invalidates the auto-updater for every existing install.

## Files that carry a version

When bumping the release version, edit all of:

| File | What to change |
|---|---|
| [`apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`](../apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml) | `version = "X.Y.Z"` (top of file) |
| [`apps/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`](../apps/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json) | `"version": "X.Y.Z"` |
| [`Cargo.lock`](../Cargo.lock) | Auto-updates on the next `cargo` invocation; commit the resulting diff |
| [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) | Rename `## [Unreleased]` → `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` and start a fresh empty `[Unreleased]` block above it |

`apps/desktop/package.json` carries an unrelated `"version"` field that does **not** track release versions. Do not touch it as part of a release cut.

## Cutting a release

This is the path used for every release the project has shipped so far. PR title convention is `chore: prepare vX.Y.Z` (see commits `8891757`, `e302676`, `709ceee`, `5205d8a` for prior cuts).

1. **Confirm `main` is green.** `git pull origin main && pnpm check` must pass locally. Don't skip — the release workflow doesn't re-run `pnpm check`.
2. **Create the prep branch.** `git checkout -b chore/prepare-vX.Y.Z`.
3. **Bump the version files** (table above). Run `cargo build -p yapstack-desktop` once to let `Cargo.lock` regenerate.
4. **Roll the CHANGELOG.**
   - Cross-reference each `[Unreleased]` entry with the PR it came from (`(#NN)` at end of line). Use `git log --oneline TAG..HEAD` to enumerate.
   - Rename the section header from `## [Unreleased]` to `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` (today's date, ISO 8601).
   - Insert a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` block above the new dated section.
5. **Sweep the docs.** For any user-visible feature in this release, check whether the relevant doc still accurately describes the surface:
   - [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) — for cross-cutting changes (data flow, IPC, state).
   - [`docs/API_REFERENCE.md`](API_REFERENCE.md) — for added/removed/renamed Tauri commands or struct fields.
   - [`docs/GLOSSARY.md`](GLOSSARY.md) and [`docs/UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md`](UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md) — for new domain terms.
   - [`docs/FRONTEND.md`](FRONTEND.md) — for new UI surfaces, shortcuts, or patterns.
   - [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`](IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md) — append a new `## Phase N — <title>` entry covering "what was built / bugs being addressed / key decisions / files changed / what was learned." This is the project's design-history record; future-you will read it to understand *why*.
   - [`README.md`](../README.md) — only if install / platform support / first-run flow changed. The alpha warning is intentionally generic — leave it alone.
6. **Open the prep PR.** Title `chore: prepare vX.Y.Z (#NN)`. Description should at minimum:
   - Name the user-visible PRs folded into this cut (with `#NN` links).
   - Confirm `pnpm check` passed.
   - Call out any docs that were swept.
7. **Merge to `main`.** Standard squash merge.
8. **Tag and push.**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```
   The push triggers the release workflow. **Tag-pushing is the trigger; do not also create the GitHub Release manually.**
9. **Watch the workflow.** `gh run watch` on the latest release run. It takes ~15–25 min on macos-latest including signing + notarization. If it fails, fix forward (do not delete the tag — see "Hotfix and recovery").
10. **Review the draft release.** When the workflow completes, a draft Release exists for the tag with the DMG, the `.app.tar.gz` + `.sig`, `latest.json`, and `checksums-sha256.txt` attached. Open it and:
    - Verify the auto-generated release notes look right (GitHub generates them from PRs since the previous tag). Edit prose into the body — the CHANGELOG entry for this version is the source of truth; copying it in is encouraged.
    - Sanity-check that `latest.json`'s `version` matches the tag and the URL points at the uploaded `.app.tar.gz`.
    - Download the DMG, install it on a clean macOS Apple Silicon machine, and exercise the golden path (start a session, dictation, system audio capture, verify auto-update points at the new version).
11. **Publish the draft.** From the GitHub Releases UI, uncheck "Set as a pre-release" only if this is a stable (non-alpha/beta/rc) release; otherwise leave it as a pre-release. Click **Publish release**. Existing installs running the auto-updater will pick up `latest.json` on their next check.

## Verification before publish

Don't skip these — the auto-updater silently pushes whatever `latest.json` references to every install.

- [ ] DMG installs cleanly on macOS Apple Silicon and launches.
- [ ] First-run permission prompts (microphone, screen recording for system audio) still surface correctly.
- [ ] A session records, transcribes, and saves; the WAV plays back.
- [ ] Dictation works (mic-only, with and without volume ducking if enabled).
- [ ] Auto-updater check from the previous version → this version succeeds end-to-end (pre-publish: side-load the new build via DMG; post-publish: verify the in-app updater can step from the previous tag's install).
- [ ] `latest.json` `signature` field is non-empty (means `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` was wired correctly).
- [ ] `checksums-sha256.txt` matches what `shasum -a 256 *.dmg` reports locally on the downloaded artifact.

## Hotfix and recovery

- **The build failed mid-workflow.** Push a fix-forward commit to `main` and re-tag with the *next* patch number — don't reuse the failed tag. The previous failed run produced no artifacts, so there's nothing to clean up.
- **The build succeeded but the draft is wrong** (notes typo, missing asset, regression caught during review). Edit the draft directly. Do **not** publish until corrected. If the artifact is bad, delete the draft, fix forward, re-tag.
- **A bad release was published.** Pull the release back to "draft" or delete it. Cut a new patch release immediately — `latest.json` only points at the most-recent published release, so the auto-updater will steer existing installs to the fix on their next check (24h cadence by default). Note in the new release notes that the prior version was withdrawn.
- **Never delete a published tag.** Even a withdrawn release keeps its tag for forensic history. Deleting tags breaks `git describe`, the changelog cross-references, and confuses anyone bisecting an issue.
- **Never `git push --force` to `main`** as part of a release.

## Required secrets

Configured on the `release` GitHub Actions environment. Do not commit these or echo them in build logs.

| Secret | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` | Base64 of the Developer ID Application `.p12` |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | Password for the `.p12` |
| `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` | e.g. `Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)` |
| `APPLE_ID` | Apple ID for notarization submission |
| `APPLE_PASSWORD` | App-specific password (not the Apple ID password) |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Apple Developer team ID |
| `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` | Tauri minisign **private** key (paired with the public key in `tauri.conf.json`) |
| `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` | Password for the minisign private key |
| `APTABASE_KEY` | Analytics key embedded in the build |

If any of these are unset or invalid, the workflow will fail at the signing or notarization step. The fix is in repo settings — not in the workflow file.

## Public-facing copy

CHANGELOG entries, release notes, and any in-app onboarding copy that ships with the release count as **public-facing copy** under [`AGENTS.md` § Permission boundaries](../AGENTS.md#ask-first). A human writes these. Tooling can suggest, but the release-cut commit's copy is on the maintainer's name.
