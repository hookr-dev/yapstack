> [!WARNING]
> **YapStack v1.0.0-alpha.5 — first public alpha release (2026-04-28).** Officially supported on macOS (Apple Silicon recommended). Builds on Intel Macs and Windows are experimental — see [Platform Support](#platform-support) below. Schema and APIs may evolve; pin a tag for any serious use.

> [!NOTE]
> **Vibe-coded with AI assistance.** YapStack is built using AI pair-programming as a first-class part of the workflow, and we plan to keep iterating that way. Contributions are welcome — your prompts, enhancements, modifications, and PRs back into the project. Bring whatever tools you want; we care about correctness, design clarity, and tests, not provenance.

YapStack is a privacy-first desktop app that captures mic and system audio, transcribes it locally using [Whisper](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) or [Parakeet TDT](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3), and organizes everything into searchable, editable notes. All processing happens on-device — nothing leaves your machine.

## Highlights

### Never miss a word

Always-on ring buffer (up to 5 min) captures audio before you hit record. Start a session and rewind to grab what you missed. Backfill transcribes retroactively while live transcription continues in parallel.

### Real-time transcription

Choose between **Whisper** (Metal-accelerated, broad language support) and **Parakeet TDT v3** (NVIDIA, faster on Apple Silicon via WebGPU + int8). Per-source VAD, hallucination filtering, two-tier prompt context for continuity. All on-device.

### Speaker diarization

Optional multi-speaker labeling via Sortformer (Parakeet only). Rename `Speaker 1` / `Speaker 2` to whatever fits the meeting.

### Full audio capture

Sessions stream to WAV incrementally. Play back at 6 speeds (0.5×–2×) with seeking. Click any transcript timestamp to jump to that moment.

### Voice dictation

Global shortcut-driven dictation with deep customization:

- **Multiple slots** — Named slots with custom global keybinds.
- **Activation modes** — Hold-to-talk or toggle.
- **AI processing** — Per-slot system prompts to transform speech (e.g. "Clean & Focus", "Create Spec").
- **Output actions** — Paste into active app, copy to clipboard, or create a new note.
- **Status bubble** — Floating overlay (listening → transcribing → processing → done).
- **History** — Past dictations grouped by day with audio replay.

### AI session chat

Per-session chat with tool calling: rename, pin, save to notes, tag, organize into folders — each with 10s undo. AI cites transcript segments as clickable timestamp chips.

### Rich notes editor

Tiptap split-pane editor alongside the transcript. Version history with restore.

### Mic + system audio

Capture mic, system audio, or both. Independent per-source VAD. Stream health monitoring with auto-restart (up to 3 attempts).

### Organization & search

Folders with icons and colors, pinning, drag-and-drop sorting, Cmd+K search across sessions, notes, and segments.

### Desktop integration

System tray with quick actions. Fully customizable global shortcuts. Recording indicator overlay. Close-to-minimize.

## Platform Support

| Platform              | Status                  | Notes |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | ✅ Officially supported | Primary target. Metal acceleration for Whisper, WebGPU + int8 Parakeet. |
| macOS (Intel)         | ⚠️ Best-effort           | Builds, but reduced performance and limited testing. |
| Windows               | 🧪 Experimental          | **Not officially supported.** CI/CD does not produce Windows builds. CUDA support exists in code; you may build and run locally at your own discretion. Official Windows support is planned for a future release. |
| Linux                 | ❌ Not yet               | No current build target. |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** ≥ 1.77.2 — install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs)
- **Node.js** ≥ 22
- **pnpm** — `corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@latest-10 --activate`
- **cmake** — required only if building with the `whisper` feature flag

### Setup

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development

```bash
# Full app (Tauri + Vite)
pnpm tauri dev

# Frontend only
pnpm --filter @yapstack/desktop dev
```

### Build

```bash
pnpm tauri build
```

### Testing

```bash
# Everything
pnpm check          # Rust build + test + fmt + clippy + TS typecheck + ESLint + vitest

# Selective
pnpm test           # Rust + frontend tests
pnpm test:frontend  # Vitest only
pnpm test:rust      # cargo test --all
pnpm lint           # Rust fmt + clippy + ESLint
pnpm typecheck      # TypeScript type checking
```

## Architecture

Tauri v2 app with a Rust backend and React frontend. Five crates handle distinct concerns:

| Crate | Role |
|-------|------|
| `yapstack-common` | Shared types, config, audio utilities |
| `yapstack-audio` | Lock-free ring buffers, mic/system capture, WAV export |
| `yapstack-transcription` | Model management, sidecar IPC |
| `yapstack-sidecar` | Standalone Whisper / Parakeet inference binary |
| `yapstack-desktop` | Tauri command layer, live transcription controller |

## Contributing

PRs welcome. Run `pnpm check` before submitting (Rust fmt + clippy + tests, frontend typecheck + lint + vitest). See [`docs/PRINCIPLES.md`](docs/PRINCIPLES.md) for the design and testing posture, and [`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for build details (including local Windows builds for the curious).

User-visible changes should include a corresponding entry in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) under `## [Unreleased]`.
